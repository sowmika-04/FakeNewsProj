This project uses various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify news articles as fake or real. We leverage scikit-learn for building the models and Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to detect fake news by processing news headlines using machine learning models. The project includes data pre-processing, feature extraction, classifier building, model evaluation, and real-time fake news detection via Kafka.
